# EvolutionaryDNN
## Plan
1. Implement CNN in TensorFlow
  - Understand of CNN (Mathematical details)
2. Identify adjustable parameters
  - Feature maps, weighting
3. Pick / Survey 1 to 2 interesting Problem
  - Accuracy around 80%
4. Implement evolution of parameters
  - Differential evolution
5. (Optional) Implement evolution of strategies
  - Speed up / predict the performance of DNN without evaluation
6. Evaluate the final DNN and short report
